moodle-filter_html5embed
========================
This was an experiment to use one of the various HTML5 libraries to give better embedding and control to MP4 and other formats. It is no longer supported or being updated and not recommended for use on a live server.

Code is left as an example for others to learn from.

//Moodle HTML5 Embed Filter using MediaElement.js 
//To use this filter you should first install it in your Moodle then enable it. 
//After that you should disable some of the default Media Embedding settings 
//Site Administration->Appearance->Media Embedding 
//You need to uncheck MP3, Flash Video, HTML5 Audio, HTML5 Video and Quicktime as all of these will be taken care of by this filter
